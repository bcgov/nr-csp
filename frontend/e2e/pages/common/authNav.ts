// The scaffold assumes an NR Landing page with an IDIR button to click and an
// IN-MEMORY session that a full page.goto() would drop. CSP does NOT work that
// way: frontend/src/context/auth/MockAuthProvider.tsx returns
// `isAuthenticated: true` immediately, with the role read from
// localStorage['csp.mockRole'] (default 'ADMIN'). See also frontend/src/env.ts —
// mock auth requires BOTH `mockUser: true` in public/amplify-config.js (that
// file is GITIGNORED: local-only) AND a localhost hostname.
//
// Consequences, and why there is no login dance below:
//   * there is nothing to click — the app is authenticated on first paint;
//   * the session is NOT in-memory-only, so page.goto() to a protected route is
//     safe and clientSideNavigate() is optional (kept for parity/other apps).
